# Q-Learning-MountainCar-Project

# Project Title

A full Q-Learning Reinforcement project using GYM enviornment 

## Getting Started

In order to run the project on your local machine -all you need to do this download all of the repository as  a zip through github option. All of the code is in python file ,so now after downloading a the file open a suitable compiler like spyder and run the code files.

Please see the name of files for the desire code file(See File Description)
 
### File Description and other details
<h1>Gym Environment</h1>
1-Intro_Table.py-Implementation of Q-table(Used in conjuction with Q Learning_Algorithm_and_Agent.py)

<p>2-Q Learning_Algorithm_and_Agent-Used Gym environment to train a agent which works on the principle of Q-Learning
plus the agent works and learn in the gym environment(https://gym.openai.com/envs/MountainCar-v0/)</p>

<p>3-Q-Learning_Agent_Analysis.py-Simple Script if you want to check how well your agent performed</p>

<h2>Own Environment</h2>

<p>1-Own-Environment-Q-Learning.py- My own environment a game of Blob where player is a blue blob and the player has to capture food(green blob) and avoid enemy(red blob)</p>

<p>2-Deep Q Learning-Implementation of Deep Neural Network which works on the princples of this paper(https://web.stanford.edu/class/psych209/Readings/MnihEtAlHassibis15NatureControlDeepRL.pdf) and learns to act in my environment.
